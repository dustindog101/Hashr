# Hashr


This program quickly computes hashes from text and files

USAGE:
this program can either be used by the command line or as a stand alone console application.
if used as a console application the program will detect if you entered a file path or if you entered text and will display its hash.

commandline args are -h,-a,-t,-f

-a sets the algorithm it should hash the input with
-t sets the input type to text
-f sets the input type to a file
-h displays a help screen

Currently the program only supports SHA1 but other algorithms are coming very soon.
